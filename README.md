# Basic Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains Python scripts and exercises for learning and practicing fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python. Each subfolder focuses on a specific topic, with hands-on code examples, scripts, and small projects.

## Folder Structure

- **1_intro_classes_unittests/**: Introduction to Python classes and unit testing. Includes basic exercises and test scripts.
- **2_python_arrays/**: Review and practice of Python array operations and basic algorithms.
- **3_work_with_files/**: Working with files in Python, including reading, writing, and processing CSV and text files.
- **4_classes_and_objects/**: Object-oriented programming examples, such as an online shop simulation.
- **5_web_scraping/**: Web scraping scripts, including OOP and procedural approaches for parsing job boards and saving results.
- **6_linked_lists/**: Implementation and practice with singly linked lists.
- **7_stacks/**: Stack data structures implemented using both Python lists and linked lists.
- **8_queues/**: Queue data structures implemented using Python lists and linked lists (with and without tail pointers).
- **9_linear_and_binary_search/**: Linear and binary search algorithm implementations.
- **10_bubble_and_insertion_sort/**: Bubble sort and insertion sort algorithm implementations.

## Example Scripts
- `website_parser_OOP.py`: Object-oriented web scraper for job postings.
- `book_processor_OOP.py`: OOP approach to processing book data from files.
- `linked_lists.py`, `stacks_using_linked_lists.py`, `queues_using_linked_lists.py`: Core data structure implementations.

## Usage
Open any script in your preferred Python environment (VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter, etc.) and run or modify the code to experiment with the concepts. Each folder is self-contained and can be explored independently.

## Purpose
This collection is intended for students and self-learners who want to build a  foundation in data structures and algorithms using Python, and are looking for practical, hands-on examples.
